## Steps

1. Push `Astrolabe/` to GitHub (standalone repo or monorepo).
2. In [Railway](https://railway.app), create a new project from GitHub.
3. If monorepo, set **Root Directory** to `Astrolabe`.
4. Add environment variables:
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...`
   - `ASTROLABE_API_KEY=...` (long random secret)
   - `PORT=3000` (optional)
5. Deploy and copy your public URL.
6. Point OpenClaw to `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/v1`.

## Security checklist

1. Keep `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` private.
2. Always set `ASTROLABE_API_KEY` on public deployments.
3. Rotate keys immediately if leaked.
