description: "Use Astrolabe as OpenClaw's OpenAI-compatible base URL."

## Update your OpenClaw endpoint

1. Set OpenClaw's base URL to your Astrolabe host.
2. Keep using OpenAI-compatible `chat/completions` requests.
3. Set OpenClaw's API key to the same value as `ASTROLABE_API_KEY`.

### Base URL examples

1. Before: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
2. Local Astrolabe: `http://localhost:3000/v1`
3. Railway Astrolabe: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/v1`

## Compatibility notes

- Endpoint: `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- Request body: OpenAI-compatible chat completion payload
- Response body: OpenRouter passthrough shape (`id`, `choices`, `usage`, etc.)
- Streaming: enabled by default unless you send `stream: false`

<Info>
Set `ASTROLABE_API_KEY` in production. If it is empty, your public endpoint is unauthenticated.
