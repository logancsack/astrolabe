OpenAI-compatible chat completion endpoint routed by Astrolabe.

## What this endpoint does

`POST /v1/chat/completions` keeps your existing request shape, but adds policy behavior before upstream execution:

1. request classification (category + complexity)
2. high-stakes safety logic
3. cost-aware routing and fallback handling
4. optional non-stream self-check with one-step escalation

## Response contract

The JSON/SSE body remains OpenAI-compatible.

Astrolabe adds `x-astrolabe-*` metadata headers so you can inspect route decisions without parsing server logs.

Key headers:

- `x-astrolabe-category`: policy category chosen
- `x-astrolabe-complexity`: classifier complexity
- `x-astrolabe-adjusted-complexity`: complexity after routing-profile adjustment
- `x-astrolabe-initial-model`: first successfully used upstream model
- `x-astrolabe-final-model`: final model after optional escalation
- `x-astrolabe-route-label`: policy label (`DEFAULT`, `VALUE`, `STANDARD`, `ESCALATE`, `BUDGET_GUARDRAIL`, `FORCED`, etc.)
- `x-astrolabe-escalated`: whether non-stream response escalated

## Forced-model behavior

If `ASTROLABE_FORCE_MODEL` is set:

- classifier routing is bypassed
- self-check escalation is skipped
- initial and final model remain the forced model ID

## Use this endpoint when

- you want OpenAI-compatible client behavior with centralized cost/safety routing
- you need route transparency through metadata headers
- you want fallback and escalation logic outside client code
