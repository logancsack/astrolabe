---

Astrolabe exposes a single OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

- `POST /v1/chat/completions`

It accepts standard chat completion payloads and forwards them to OpenRouter after model-tier routing.

## Authentication

If `ASTROLABE_API_KEY` is configured, send one of:

- `Authorization: Bearer <ASTROLABE_API_KEY>`
- `x-api-key: <ASTROLABE_API_KEY>`

If `ASTROLABE_API_KEY` is empty, requests are accepted without inbound auth.

## Streaming behavior

- Default: streaming (`stream` omitted or true)
- Non-streaming: send `stream: false` for JSON response + self-check/escalation flow
