---

Astrolabe exposes:

- `GET /health`
- `POST /v1/chat/completions`

It accepts standard chat completion payloads and forwards them to OpenRouter after policy-based model routing.

Use `GET /health` to confirm active runtime mode values such as `routing_profile` and `cost_efficiency_mode`.

## Authentication

If `ASTROLABE_API_KEY` is configured, send one of:

- `Authorization: Bearer <ASTROLABE_API_KEY>`
- `x-api-key: <ASTROLABE_API_KEY>`

If `ASTROLABE_API_KEY` is empty, requests are accepted without inbound auth.

## Streaming behavior

- Default: streaming (`stream` omitted or true)
- Non-streaming: send `stream: false` for JSON response + self-check/escalation flow
- Default release profile is budget-first with strict cost-efficiency guardrails enabled.

## High-stakes strict mode

This is separate from `ASTROLABE_COST_EFFICIENCY_MODE=strict` (cost routing behavior).

If `ASTROLABE_HIGH_STAKES_CONFIRM_MODE=strict`, high-stakes requests require an exact confirmation token before execution:

- `x-astrolabe-confirmed: <ASTROLABE_HIGH_STAKES_CONFIRM_TOKEN>`
- `metadata.astrolabe_confirmed: "<ASTROLABE_HIGH_STAKES_CONFIRM_TOKEN>"`
