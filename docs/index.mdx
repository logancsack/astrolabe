Astrolabe is a headless OpenAI-compatible proxy that sits between OpenClaw and OpenRouter.

It receives each request, decides how risky and complex it is, routes to an appropriate model tier, and returns the same API shape clients already expect.

## Why teams use Astrolabe

Astrolabe is designed for environments where all three constraints matter at once:

- response quality must stay high
- model spend must stay predictable
- safety-sensitive actions need stronger controls

Instead of choosing one global model for everything, Astrolabe chooses per request.

## At-a-glance architecture

1. OpenClaw sends `POST /v1/chat/completions`.
2. Astrolabe classifies category/complexity and applies safety + cost policy.
3. Astrolabe selects a model and fallback chain.
4. OpenRouter executes on the selected provider/model.
5. Astrolabe returns response + routing metadata headers.

For implementation-level policy detail, see [Routing Reference](/routing-reference) and [Model Roster Reference](/model-roster).

## Core capabilities

1. Category-aware routing across 12 operational categories.
2. Safety-gate checks for high-stakes requests.
3. Cost-efficiency guardrails to reduce unnecessary premium model usage.
4. One-step self-check escalation for low-confidence non-stream responses.
5. Model fallback chains for provider/model availability issues.
6. Traceability through `x-astrolabe-*` headers and structured logs.
